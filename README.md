## 🔍 Project Objective

This project aims to turn student event feedback into actionable insights using data science.  
By analyzing both numerical ratings and text feedback from students across various college events (seminars, workshops, cultural), we identify satisfaction trends, perform sentiment analysis, and suggest improvements.

The dataset contains the following columns:

- Student ID – Unique ID of student  
- Event Type – Type of event (Workshop, Seminar, Cultural)  
- Department – Student's department  
- Rating – Feedback rating (1 to 5 scale)  
- Feedback – Open-ended student comment  
- Sentiment – Pre-annotated sentiment (Positive/Neutral/Negative)

## 📌 Key Recommendations for Improvement

Based on the analysis of over 170+ student feedback entries across workshops, seminars, and cultural events, here are some actionable recommendations:

1. 🎤 **Cultural Events Need Better Coordination**  
   - Feedback indicates issues like poor sound systems, disorganized management, and lack of refreshments.  
   - Suggest appointing event coordinators with backup plans and technical support.

2. 🕒 **Seminar Timing & Engagement Can Be Improved**  
   - Students felt many seminars were too long or hard to follow.  
   - Recommend keeping sessions concise with Q&A breaks and visual aids for clarity.

3. 💡 **Workshops Perform Well, but Can Be More Interactive**  
   - While workshops received the highest ratings overall, some comments mentioned boredom.  
   - Encourage interactive elements like live demos or group activities to boost energy.

4. 🧑‍🏫 **Department-Wise Variation Needs Attention**  
   - Departments like Civil and Mech had more negative feedback compared to CSE and EEE.  
   - Encourage cross-department learning for organizing impactful events.

5. 🗣️ **Improve Feedback Handling Loop**  
   - Several recurring issues were observed across events but not addressed over time.  
   - Recommend a feedback-action-feedback loop where students are shown what was improved from previous feedback.
